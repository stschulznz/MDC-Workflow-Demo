# MDC-Workflow-Demo

This will add a simple workflow automation demonstration which triggers on an MDC ransomware and will then use Teams adaptive cards to ask whether the machine should be isolated using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Note that the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint step has been replaced with a Compose message to avoid isolating a real machine.
